        //*******codeSTACKr***

        //A promise does something if something else is true, if it is not true then it wont.
        //A promise is used to handle an assynchronous result of an operation.
        //With promises we can defer a codeblock untill a assynchronous request is completed. This way other operations can keep running without interruption.
        //A lot of modern javascript libraries uses promises.
        //Promises can hav 3 states pending , fulfilled and rejected.


        //lets now make our first promise called - meeting
        const hasMeeting = true;
        const meeting = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            if (hasMeeting) {
                const meetingDetails = {
                    name: "Marketing Meeting",
                    location: "Skype",
                    time: "1:00PM",
                    printMeetingDetails: () => {
                        console.log(`You have a ${meetingDetails.name} at ${meetingDetails.time}. Location: ${meetingDetails.location}`)
                    }
                }
                resolve(meetingDetails)
            } else {
                reject(new Error("ERROR: Meeting already/not scheduled"))
            }
        })

        //make another promise - addToCallender  - with one variable- just return promise.resolve(variable)variable at the end instead of creating a promise first then recolve()
        const addToCalender = meetingDetails => {

            // return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            const calender = `${meetingDetails.name} is scheduled at ${meetingDetails.time} on ${meetingDetails.location}`
                //resolve(calender)
                // })
            return Promise.resolve(calender) //alternative for the 3 commented lines above

            /*

             return Promise.resolve(newMessage)
             */
        }

        //to chain these two promises , we add a .then with addToCallender promise.This way if our meeting promise is resolved/succesful, then addToCalender promise is exceted. else both do are not excecuted.
        meeting
            .then(addToCalender)
            .then(res => {
                //resolve data
                console.log("Meeting Scheduled")
                console.log(res)
            })
            .catch(err => {
                //reject data
                console.log(err.message)
            })

        //SEEVERAL PROM(ISES

        const promise1 = Promise.resolve("Promise 1 complete")
        const promise2 = new Promise((res, rej) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                res("Promise 2 complete")
            }, 3000)
        })

        ////to call them one at a time
        //promise1.then(res => console.log(res))
        //promise2.then(res => console.log(res))

        // //to call them both/if many all at the same time - you get them both as an array . use Promise.all()
        // Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(res => console.log(res))

        // //To return only the first promise to be completed we use Promise.race - in this case yu get the first promise1 which is immediate since it has no time out.
        Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(res => console.log(res))


        //PROMISES STILL USE CALBACKS BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO READ AND WRITE. THEY PROVIDE A WAY TO CONTINUE OUR CODE WHILE WAITING FOR SOMETHING ELSE.
