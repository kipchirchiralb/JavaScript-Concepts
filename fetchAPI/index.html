    <h1>Working with data and APIs in JavaScript</h1>

    <h1>Fetch API</h1>
    <h5>Fetch is similar to xml or http requests but better. I allows us to get or post data from and to a server.</h5>
    <p>Fetch always succeeds therefore <strong> .cath(error => console.log(error)</strong> will not return any error. The only time you get an error is when you get an errorwith fetch itself and not the api you are calling. For example absence of internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        To curb this, ypou can check if response is ok in the first ,then
    </p>
    <p>Fetch has an options section - where you can get post delete data </p>
    <p>Fetch takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch and returns a <strong>Promise</strong> the resolves <strong>resolves</strong> to the <strong>response</strong>to thet request. That is as soon as the server responds with
        headers - <strong>
        even if the server response is a HTTP error status.
    </strong> You can also optionally pass an init option object as the second argument,</p>
    <p>Once the <strong>response</strong> is retrieved there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and and how it should be handled.</p>
